        Unfinished phrases<br>
        Half formed thoughts <br>
        Unable to alchemy the full range of my feeling into the English language <br>
        Maybe they aren’t ready<br>
        They need further coaxing <br>
        But the sun has set <br>
        And I have nothing <br>
        Not even my words to keep me comfort</p>
